# Flow

Let the music flow! Flow is the name of this music app.

## Project description

Flow is a portfolio project created by me (James Cao) during the App Academy's Full-stack Web Development program. It's a simplified version of Spotify / SoundCloud, two popular music-sharing and streaming apps on the market. But I came up with my own design style in the end. It's just for learning purposes.
